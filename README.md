# Network Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning
A comprehensive Network Intrusion Detection System that combines machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify and classify cyber threats in real-time. This system utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature optimization, XGBoost for known attack classification, and Autoencoder for novel anomaly detection to provide multi-layered security monitoring.

The project includes a user-friendly Gradio web interface that allows security analysts to simulate network traffic patterns and receive instant threat assessments with detailed visual analytics, confidence scores, and anomaly detection metrics.
